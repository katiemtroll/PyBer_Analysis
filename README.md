# Analysis for PyBer

## Overview of Analysis
V. Isualize and Omar requested an analysis of PyBer data, including a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type. There needs to be a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type, and a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used to influence decisions for PyBer.

## Results
Two data files containing city and ride-specific information were used for this analysis. The data was used to find information for each of the three city types (rural, suburban, and urban), including:
* Total Rides
* Total Drivers
* Total Fares
* Average Fare Per Ride By City Type
* Average Fare Per Driver By City Type

***insert image***

As is seen in the image above, lower average fare per ride/driver resulted in higher total rides and overall total fares. This is indicative that a high volume of rides at a lower rate is more profitable to PyBer than a low volume of rides at a higher rate.

## Summary and Future Use Cases
#### There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. 

Based on this analysis, there are three recommendations for PyBer to improve business opportunities.
1. Capitalize on lowest volume days of the week in low volume cities by lowering fare prices to encourage more rides. 
2. Ensure there are enough drivers to meet demand in rural and suburban cities. One reason there may not be as many rides may be because there are not enough drivers, or:
3. Increase marketing campaigns in low volume cities. Another reason there may not be as many rides in these cities may be because not as many community members are aware of PyBer's ride-share program.
